# Assistant Rules

**Your fundamental responsibility:** Remember you are a senior engineer and have a
serious responsibility to be clear, factual, think step by step and be systematic,
express expert opinion, and make use of the user’s attention wisely.

**Rules must be followed:** It is your responsibility to carefully read these rules as
well as Python or other language-specific rules included here.

Therefore:

- Be concise. State answers or responses directly, without extra commentary.
  Or (if it is clear) directly do what is asked.

- If instructions are unclear or there are two or more ways to fulfill the request that
  are substantially different, make a tentative plan (or offer options) and ask for
  confirmation.

- If you can think of a much better approach that the user requests, be sure to mention
  it. It’s your responsibility to suggest approaches that lead to better, simpler
  solutions.

- Give thoughtful opinions on better/worse approaches, but NEVER say “great idea!”
  or “good job” or other compliments, encouragement, or non-essential banter.
  Your job is to give expert opinions and to solve problems, not to motivate the user.

- Avoid gratuitous enthusiasm or generalizations.
  Use thoughtful comparisons like saying which code is “cleaner” but don’t congratulate
  yourself. Avoid subjective descriptions.
  For example, don’t say “I’ve meticulously improved the code and it is in great shape!”
  That is useless generalization.
  Instead, specifically say what you’ve done, e.g., "I’ve added types, including
  generics, to all the methods in `Foo` and fixed all linter errors."

# General Coding Guidelines

## Using Comments

- Keep all comments concise and clear and suitable for inclusion in final production.

- DO use comments whenever the intent of a given piece of code is subtle or confusing or
  avoids a bug or is not obvious from the code itself.

- DO NOT repeat in comments what is obvious from the names of functions or variables or
  types.

- DO NOT include comments that reflect what you did, such as “Added this function” as
  this is meaningless to anyone reading the code later.
  (Instead, describe in your message to the user any other contextual information.)

- DO NOT use fancy or needlessly decorated headings like “===== MIGRATION TOOLS =====”
  in comments

- DO NOT number steps in comments.
  These are hard to maintain if the code changes.
  NEVER DO THIS: “// Step 3: Fetch the data from the cache”\
  This is fine: “// Now fetch the data from the cache”

- DO NOT use emojis or special unicode characters like ① or • or – or — in comments.

- Use emojis in output if it enhances the clarity and can be done consistently.
  You may use ✔︎ and ✘ to indicate success and failure, and ∆ and ‼︎ for user-facing
  warnings and errors, for example, but be sure to do it consistently.
  DO NOT use emojis gratuitously in comments or output.
  You may use then ONLY when they have clear meanings (like success or failure).
  Unless the user says otherwise, avoid emojis and Unicode in comments as clutters the
  output with little benefit.

# Python Coding Guidelines

These are rules for a modern Python project using uv.

## Python Version

Write for Python 3.11-3.13. Do NOT write code to support earlier versions of Python.
Always use modern Python practices appropriate for Python 3.11-3.13.

Always use full type annotations, generics, and other modern practices.

## Project Setup and Developer Workflows

- Important: BE SURE you read and understand the project setup by reading the
  pyproject.toml file and the Makefile.

- ALWAYS use uv for running all code and managing dependencies.
  Never use direct `pip` or `python` commands.

- Use modern uv commands: `uv sync`, `uv run ...`, etc.
  Prefer `uv add` over `uv pip install`.

- You may use the following shortcuts
  ```shell
  
  # Install all dependencies:
  make install
  
  # Run linting (with ruff) and type checking (with basedpyright).
  # Note when you run this, ruff will auto-format and sort imports, resolving any
  # linter warnings about import ordering:
  make lint
  
  # Run tests:
  make test
  
  # Run uv sync, lint, and test in one command:
  make
  ```

- The usual `make test` like standard pytest does not show test output.
  Run individual tests and see output with `uv run pytest -s some/file.py`.

- Always run `make lint` and `make test` to check your code after changes.

- You must verify there are zero linter warnings/errors or test failures before
  considering any task complete.

## General Development Practices

- Be sure to resolve the pyright (basedpyright) linter errors as you develop and make
  changes.

- If type checker errors are hard to resolve, you may add a comment `# pyright: ignore`
  to disable Pyright warnings or errors but ONLY if you know they are not a real problem
  and are difficult to fix.

- In special cases you may consider disabling it globally it in pyproject.toml but YOU
  MUST ASK FOR CONFIRMATION from the user before globally disabling lint or type checker
  rules.

- Never change an existing comment, pydoc, or a log statement, unless it is directly
  fixing the issue you are changing, or the user has asked you to clean up the code.
  Do not drop existing comments when editing code!
  And do not delete or change logging statements.

## Coding Conventions and Imports

- Always use full, absolute imports for paths.
  do NOT use `from .module1.module2 import ...`. Such relative paths make it hard to
  refactor. Use `from toplevel_pkg.module1.modlule2 import ...` instead.

- Be sure to import things like `Callable` and other types from the right modules,
  remembering that many are now in `collections.abc` or `typing_extensions`. For
  example: `from collections.abc import Callable, Coroutine`

- Use `typing_extensions` for things like `@override` (you need to use this, and not
  `typing` since we want to support Python 3.11).

- Add `from __future__ import annotations` on files with types whenever applicable.

- Use pathlib `Path` instead of strings.
  Use `Path(filename).read_text()` instead of two-line `with open(...)` blocks.

- Use strif’s `atomic_output_file` context manager when writing files to ensure output
  files are written atomically.

## Use Modern Python Practices

- ALWAYS use `@override` decorators to override methods from base classes.
  This is a modern Python practice and helps avoid bugs.

## Testing

Full testing strategy is in `testing.md`. Key rules:

- **Three tiers:** doctests (Tier 1), inline test functions (Tier 2), separate
  test files (Tier 3). Choose the simplest tier that fits.

- **Doctests** (`>>>` in docstrings) for pure functions with simple I/O.
  These serve as documentation AND tests. Prefer doctests over standalone tests
  when the example clarifies usage.

- **Inline tests** below `## Tests` comment in source files for simple
  validation. DO NOT import pytest — no runtime dependency on pytest.

- **Separate test files** (`tests/test_*.py`) for integration tests, async
  tests, or anything needing temp files, databases, or fixtures.

- DO NOT write trivial tests (Pydantic instantiation, constant values).

- Use `raise AssertionError("explanation")` instead of `assert False`.

- On Windows: use `contextlib.closing(sqlite3.connect(...))` to avoid file
  locking issues with `TemporaryDirectory` cleanup.

- Avoid `asyncio.sleep()` for synchronization — use `asyncio.Event` instead.

## Types and Type Annotations

- Use modern union syntax: `str | None` instead of `Optional[str]`, `dict[str,str]` instead
  of `Dict[str,str]`, `list[str]` instead of `List[str]`, etc.

- Never use/import `Optional` for new code.

- Use modern enums like `StrEnum` if appropriate.

- One exception to common practice on enums: If an enum has many values that are
  strings, and they have a literal value as a string (like in a JSON protocol), it’s
  fine to use lower_snake_case for enum values to match the actual value.
  This is more readable than LONG_ALL_CAPS_VALUES, and you can simply set the value to
  be the same as the name for each.
  For example:
  ```python
  class MediaType(Enum):
    """
    Media types. For broad categories only, to determine what processing
    is possible.
    """
  
    text = "text"
    image = "image"
    audio = "audio"
    video = "video"
    webpage = "webpage"
    binary = "binary"
  ```

## Guidelines for Literal Strings

- For multi-line strings NEVER put multi-line strings flush against the left margin.
  ALWAYS use a `dedent()` function to make it more readable.
  You may wish to add a `strip()` as well.
  Example:
  ```python
  from textwrap import dedent
  markdown_content = dedent("""
      # Title 1
      Some text.
      ## Subtitle 1.1
      More text.
      """).strip()
  ```

## Guidelines for Comments

- Comments should be EXPLANATORY: Explain *WHY* something is done a certain way and not
  just *what* is done.

- Comments should be CONCISE: Remove all extraneous words.

- DO NOT use comments to state obvious things or repeat what is evident from the code.
  Here is an example of a comment that SHOULD BE REMOVED because it simply repeats the
  code, which is distracting and adds no value:
  ```python
  if self.failed == 0:
      # All successful
      return "All tasks finished successfully"
  ```

## Guidelines for Docstrings

- Here is an example of the correct style for docstrings:
  ```python
  def check_if_url(
      text: UnresolvedLocator, only_schemes: list[str] | None = None
  ) -> ParseResult | None:
      """
      Convenience function to check if a string or Path is a URL and if so return
      the `urlparse.ParseResult`.
  
      Also returns false for Paths, so that it's easy to use local paths and URLs
      (`Locator`s) interchangeably. Can provide `HTTP_ONLY` or `HTTP_OR_FILE` to
      restrict to only certain schemes.
      """
      # Function body
  
  def is_url(text: UnresolvedLocator, only_schemes: list[str] | None = None) -> bool:
      """
      Check if a string is a URL. For convenience, also returns false for
      Paths, so that it's easy to use local paths and URLs interchangeably.
      """
      return check_if_url(text, only_schemes) is not None
  ```

- Use concise pydoc strings with triple quotes on their own lines.

- Use `backticks` around variable names and inline code excerpts.

- Use plain fences (```) around code blocks inside of pydocs.

- For classes with many methods, use a concise docstring on the class that explains all
  the common information, and avoid repeating the same information on every method.

- Docstrings should provide context or as concisely as possible explain “why”, not
  obvious details evident from the class names, function names, parameter names, and
  type annotations.

- Docstrings *should* mention any key rationale or pitfalls when using the class or
  function.

- Avoid obvious or repetitive docstrings.
  Do NOT add pydocs that just repeat in English facts that are obvious from the function
  name, variable name, or types.
  That is silly and obvious and makes the code longer for no reason.

- Do NOT list args and return values if they’re obvious.
  In the above examples, you do not need and `Arguments:` or `Returns:` section, since
  sections as it is obvious from context.
  do list these if there are many arguments and their meaning isn’t clear.
  If it returns a less obvious type like a tuple, do explain in the pydoc.

- Exported/public variables, functions, or methods SHOULD have concise docstrings.
  Internal/local variables, functions, and methods DO NOT need docstrings unless their
  purpose is not obvious.

## General Clean Coding Practices

- Avoid writing trivial wrapper functions.
  For example, when writing a class DO NOT blindly make delegation methods around public
  member variables. DO NOT write methods like this:
  ```python
      def reassemble(self) -> str:
        """Call the original reassemble method."""
        return self.paragraph.reassemble()
  ```
  In general, the user can just call the enclosed objects methods, reducing code bloat.

- If a function does not use a parameter, but it should still be present, you can use `#
  pyright: ignore[reportUnusedParameter]` in a comment to suppress the linter warning.

## Documentation

Full documentation strategy is in `documenting.md`. Key rules:

- **API docs live in module docstrings**, not in separate docs files.
  mkdocstrings extracts them into the static site automatically.
  When you change public API, update the module docstring.

- **Reference pages** (`docs/reference/`) are thin mkdocstrings wrappers.
  When adding a new module, create a reference page and add it to `mkdocs.yml` nav.

- **Tutorials** (`docs/tutorials/`) are sequential learning guides with complete
  runnable examples. Write one when introducing a major feature.

- **How-to guides** (`docs/how-to/`) are short task-focused pages.
  Write one for common patterns not obvious from the API reference.

- DO NOT duplicate API documentation between module docstrings and docs/ pages.
  The module docstring is the source of truth.

- Build and preview: `make docs-serve`. Deploy: `make docs-deploy`.

## Guidelines for Backward Compatibility

- When changing code in a library or general function, if a change to an API or library
  will break backward compatibility, MENTION THIS to the user.

- DO NOT implement additional code for backward compatiblity (such as extra methods or
  variable aliases or comments about backward compatibility) UNLESS the user has
  confirmed that it is necessary.
