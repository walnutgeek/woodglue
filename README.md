# ðŸªµ WoodGlue

> **Stronger than wood when used right**

WoodGlue is a self-documenting, opinionated async server framework that hosts both logic and data. Like the finest wood glue that creates bonds stronger than the wood itself, WoodGlue creates connections more robust than traditional server architectures.

## Why WoodGlue?

In woodworking, the right glue applied correctly creates joints that are stronger than the surrounding wood. WoodGlue follows the same principle - when properly configured, it creates server architectures that are more resilient, performant, and maintainable than traditional approaches.

### Key Features

- **Self-documenting**: Your server documents itself
- **Opinionated**: Built with best practices baked in
- **Async-first**: Modern Python async/await patterns
- **Data + Logic**: Host both your business logic and data together
- **Type-safe**: Built on Pydantic for robust data validation
- **Fast**: Powered by Polars for high-performance data operations

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install WoodGlue
pip install woodglue

# Run your server
wg
```

## Let's Build Something Together
